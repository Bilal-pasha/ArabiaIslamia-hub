# Project Structure and Entry Points

This repo is a monorepo with **one API + one app per school** under `apps/<school>/`.

- **API** (NestJS): `apps/secondary/api/`, `apps/huffaz/api/` — entry `src/main.ts`, root module `src/app.module.ts`
- **App** (Next.js App Router): `apps/secondary/app/`, `apps/huffaz/app/` — entry `app/layout.tsx` and route files under `app/`

Important app directories (per school, e.g. `apps/secondary/app/`):
- UI building blocks: shared `packages/ui/`
- App routes: `app/` (e.g. `/`, `/registration`, `/attendance`, `/fees`)
- Components, lib, services, constants: `components/`, `lib/`, `services/`, `constants/`

API docs live at [api-doc.md](mdc:api-doc.md) at repo root and are the source of truth for service types and endpoints.
